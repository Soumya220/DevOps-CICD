# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline setup using **Terraform**, **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **SonarQube**. The pipeline automates the process from code cloning to building, code quality analysis, Docker image creation, and deployment using Jenkins. 

## Tools and Technologies
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to automate cloud resource provisioning.
- **Jenkins**: Open-source automation server for building and managing CI/CD pipelines.
- **Docker**: Container platform for packaging, distributing, and running applications.
- **SonarQube**: Continuous code quality analysis tool.

## Project Structure

- **Terraform**: Used to launch an AWS EC2 instance and install Jenkins and Docker on it.
- **Jenkins Pipelines**: Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application and manage deployments.
- **SonarQube**: Integrated for code quality checks.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline
1. **Code Cloning**: Jenkins pulls the code from GitHub.
2. **Build and Test**: Executes `mvn clean install` for building and running tests.
3. **SonarQube Analysis**: Scans the code using SonarQube for quality checks.
4. **Docker Image Creation**: Builds a Docker image for the application.
5. **Push to Docker Hub**: Pushes the Docker image to a repository on Docker Hub.
6. **Trigger CD Pipeline**: Initiates the CD pipeline for deployment.

### Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline
1. **Run Docker Image**: Pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub and runs it on an EC2 instance.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- Docker Hub Account
- Jenkins installed on an EC2 instance
- Terraform installed locally
- GitHub repository with the source code and Jenkinsfile

### Steps to Set Up the Project
1. **Set Up Terraform**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance using Terraform and install Jenkins, Docker, and other required tools.

2. **Set Up Jenkins**:
   - Install necessary Jenkins plugins: Git, Maven, SonarQube Scanner, and Docker Pipeline.
   - Configure Jenkins to connect with SonarQube and Docker Hub.

3. **Create Jenkins Pipelines**:
   - Define the CI pipeline to clone the GitHub repository, run SonarQube analysis, build Docker images, and push them to Docker Hub.
   - Define the CD pipeline to pull the Docker image from Docker Hub and deploy it.

### How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. Run Terraform to launch EC2:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
3. Set up Jenkins jobs:
   - Create a Jenkins job for CI using the provided `Jenkinsfile`.
   - Create a CD pipeline job to handle the deployment.
